 * @param[in] ensemble_states Emission rates [num_ensembles Ã— num_timesteps]
 * @param[in] num_ensembles Number of ensemble members (typically 50-100)

 * @pre ensemble_states must be row-major: states[ens*num_timesteps + t]
 * @pre sources vector must contain at least one source location
 * @pre Memory: total_particles = nop * num_ensembles can be large (millions)
 *
 * @post part vector contains num_ensembles * nop particles
 * @post Particles sorted by ensemble_id, then timeidx
 * @post Each particle has valid ensemble_id field (0 to num_ensembles-1)
 *
 * @algorithm
 *   1. Reserve memory for all particles
 *   2. For each ensemble:
 *      For each time interval:
 *        - Get emission rate for this ensemble/time
 *        - Generate particles_per_timestep particles
 *        - Set ensemble_id and timeidx

 * @performance
 *   - Memory: O(num_ensembles * nop) particles
 *   - Time: O(num_ensembles * nop) particle generation
 *   - Sorting: O(N log N) where N = total particles
 *
 * @note Critical: Particles MUST be sorted by ensemble_id for GPU kernel efficiency
 * @note Each ensemble simulates independently with its own emission series
 * @note timeidx ranges from 1 to particles_per_ensemble for each ensemble
 *
 * @warning Large ensemble sizes (>100) with large nop (>100k) can exceed memory
